# Week 1

With mixed feelings at the moment. I am glad I managed to take this course this year but I am anticipating busy weeks and I am worried I won't have as much time to dedicate to the course as I would like, without sacrificing too many hours of sleep or family time with kids. But I am hoping to get more used to working with R and I believe every extra hour counts so I'll just try to do my best to keep up with the pace of the course. 

I have not yet reached the end of chapter 4 of the **R for Health Data Science** book, but at least for someone like me (I have used R before but not much or regularly) I think it is working quite well as a fresh up.
